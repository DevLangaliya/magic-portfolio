## Overview

Implementation of an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) query analysis project focusing on optimizing prompt generation, response processing, and knowledge retrieval using cutting-edge AI technologies.

## Key Features

- **LLM Optimization**: Implemented and fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-1.5B model using Hugging Face, enabling advanced prompt generation and parameter tuning.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Established a local RAG database with Llama Index to enhance LLM responses using domain-specific knowledge.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Performed advanced semantic similarity analysis using embedding vectors and cosine similarity techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Hugging Face**
- **Llama Index**
- **NumPy**
